# Holland America Assessment

This project was created to follow a mark up by the company Holland America.

 # Step 1
 Find a way to implement dummy data to map through and show on web page. Create a folder in the src folder called data which holds the dummy data. 

 # step 2
Make a component folder inside the src folder and a fild called Reservation which i will use the useSate and useEffect to caputer the data and use it to pass it to another file called ResData which holds the data from the dummy data.

# step 3
After getting the data iterate through the dummy data including the index to be used on the div key other wise there will be errors in the console. Pass the data from the useEffect, and the iterations from the map to the file which holds the card and use array deconstructing/ prop deconstruting to retrieve the data.

# css
my main focus was to use the grid system like in bootstrap or react strap, but instead i chose to use the flexbox which worked out well for mobile response.
